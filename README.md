### 💡 About me
* 🚀 **Builder:** **Web Application Development (DAW)** student driven by understanding the "how" and "why" behind tools to build solutions that truly make a difference. Currently perfecting **Java** to ensure code is clean, scalable, and efficient (Code Core).
  
* 🔍 **Insights:** Understanding the technical and logical "why" of project development and architecture is key. I believe that if data doesn't flow, the product doesn't work. Designing relational models (ER) and manipulating data with **SQL** and **XML** technologies allows for intelligent and productive management.

* 🛠️ **Environment:** I like knowing where the software I build "lives." With increasing security gaps, I focus on proper network and OS configuration to ensure software is efficient and secure from its own infrastructure.
  
* 🧩 **Strategy:** Exploring design tools to align aesthetics with real functionality and network security. I don't just learn to program; I analyze systems and design behavior and class diagrams to plan every step. My goal is to create solutions through **UX/UI prototyping** while familiarizing myself with **ERP, CRM, and SaaS** environments to understand how software solves real corporate problems. 

* 🧠 **Qualities:** My creative mind drives me to value order and business vision. I am learning to bridge technical complexity with human needs through communication and resilience. Currently, I optimize my workflow by experimenting with new tools and implementing **Scrum and Kanban** in my repositories. My approach combines autonomous learning with the study of psychosocial health and the real challenges of each role within a technical team.

* 🌿 **FreeTime:** When I'm not immersed in research or coding, I recharge with all kinds of outdoor sports. I also collaborate on social actions to maintain a connection with society and never lose sight of human perspective and needs.



> _ "My time in DAW isn't just about learning to code; it's about understanding the real challenges faced by technical teams. From database design to systems planning, I seek to master the language of development to lead projects in the future with a solid foundation and authentic communication across all areas." _
